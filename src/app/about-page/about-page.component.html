    <section>

        <!-- TODO: Tech interest early on i.e. Nintendo Gen-->
        <p>My interest in technology started from a very early age. Nintendo was essentially my introduction to technology and the potential it harnesses. I still love playing video games in my spare time.</p>


        <!-- TODO: Myspace age, computer engineering -->
        <p>Like many in my generation, my first introduction to coding, specifically HTML and basic web design, came from the worlds of Myspace and Livejournal. I enjoyed spending hours learning how to make these web pages look how I wanted. I spent a lot
            of time with my art in school, so designing these pages appealled to me. I was in AP art and even considered going to art school.</p>

        <p>In high school, I got my first taste of computer engineering. I started taking my home computer apart and putting it back together. To this day, I still build my own computers.</p>

        <p>When I am not coding, I spend my time reading, playing video games, knitting, or running. I am currently doing a running streak where I run at least one mile every day.
