        <p>I stream on Twitch occasionally to fundraise. I participate in St. Jude Play▶Live every May. During this
            time, I match donations up to $1,000. My employer matches my donations up to $1,000 annually.</p>

            <H2>What is St. Jude Children's Research Hospital?</H2>
            <p><em>St. Jude is a hospital near my hometown in Memphis, TN. They treat children with various cancers and
                    never charge families for any of it.</em></p>
            <p>St. Jude is leading the way the world understands, treats and defeats childhood cancer and other
                life-threatening diseases. And families never receive a bill from St. Jude for treatment, travel,
                housing or food — because all a family should
                worry about is helping their child live.
