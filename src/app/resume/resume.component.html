        <h3>Work Experience</h3>
        <p>I have spent the last three years working on modernizing older legacy applications and creating new single page applications to decrease customer calls. I have worked on the user interface, both designing and developing. I work with Product Owners
            to meet business requirements, while focusing on the user experience. I also work on our applications' APIs and backend-for-frontends(BFFs). I connect to the APIs of our downstream services to get data for the experience.
        </p>
        <p>I am an accessibility subject matter expert at my current position. I have spent many hours in my own training, as well as a company-sponsored group training. I am an accessibility advocate, both at work and on social media.</p>
