            <h2>Work Experience</h2>
            <p>I have spent the last six years working on modernizing older legacy applications and creating new
                single page applications to decrease customer calls. I have worked on the user interface, both designing
                and developing. I work with Product
                Owners to meet business requirements, while focusing on the user experience. I also work on our
                applications' APIs and backend-for-frontends(BFFs). I connect to the APIs of our downstream services to
                get data for the experience. I monitor
                application alerts using Splunk and maintain code quality via Veracode and Sonar,
            </p>
            <p>In addition to my role as a developer, I am also the Scrum Master. I run standup, retrospective, and
                support in grooming and sprint planning. I gather metrics, write documentation, aid with communication
                to external teams and contacts, and
                support the team as a whole. I am also the production support lead of my organization. I gather metrics
                on outages and availability, write reports on incidents, and run a weekly Operations meeting to bring
                awareness of releases, incidents,
                security, performance, and any Platform Health and maintenance work that is required. I schedule our
                production support rotations for the organization, as well as maintain Splunk alerts, xMatters alerts
                and shifts, and incident documentation.
            </p>
            <p>I am an accessibility subject matter expert at my current position. I have spent many hours in my own
                training, as well as a company-sponsored group training. I am an accessibility advocate, both at work
                and on social media. Accessibility
                is my passion, and I take every opportunity to collaborate with other teams to ensure their products are
                accessible for all. User experience as a whole is what I would consider my focus, regardless of what I
                am working on.
            </p>
            <p>Before working as a developer, I spent several years in customer service, in food service, dog grooming,
                and copy and print. I was even a manager over my department for a few months. </p>
            <h2>School</h2>
            <p>I graduated from Texas Woman's University in 2017 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and
                minor in mathematics. I studied Perl, Assembly, PHP, and Java during my time in university.</p>
            <p>I have a strong history in art and English throughout my schooling. I was in AP English and AP art in
                high school. I won several awards for my writing in high school and college. I enjoy both so much, and I
                love bringing them into my work
                in technology.</p>
